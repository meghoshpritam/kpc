# Psicologo Scolastico Theme with Tailwind CSS

## Prerequisites

Make sure to install `postcss-cli` and `autoprefixer` globally in your environment, as Hugo Pipeâ€™s PostCSS requires it. This is mentioned in the [Hugo Docs](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/postcss/).

```bash
cd exercise
npm install -g postcss-cli
npm install -g autoprefixer
```

Make sure to use a minimum Hugo version of v0.69.0 and above.


## Install the necessary node packages

```bash
npm install
```

## Run server

- switch to the root of repo and start a server:

```bash
cd exercise
hugo server -D
```
